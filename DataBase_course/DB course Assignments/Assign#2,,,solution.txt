Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by ensuring that
no two rows of data in a table have identical key values.
When you create a unique index for an existing table with data, 
values in the columns or expressions that comprise the index key are checked for uniqueness.

 on any field or sub-field of the documents in a MongoDB collection
