 “A database will be made to store information about 
patients in a hospital. On arrival, each patient’s 
personal details (name, address, and telephone number)
 are recorded where possible, and they are given an admission 
number. They are then assigned to a particular ward
 (Accident and Emergency, Cardiology, Oncology, etc.).
 In each ward, there are a number of doctors and nurses.
 Each doctor and nurse may be involved with several patients at any given time.”
